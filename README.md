Create responsive email templates in your SvelteKit applications with ease.

> [!WARNING]
> SailKit is still in its early stages. Expect changes, bugs, and rough edges.

## Overview

SailKit is an open-source toolkit for composing responsive email templates in SvelteKit applications.
It provides a set of Svelte 5 primitives and utilities to help you create optimized and responsive production-ready emails.

Visit the [SailKit documentation](https://sailkit.xyz) for more information.

## Why SailKit?

Email is notoriously challenging. crafting responsive, visually consistent emails across various email clients and devices is not a trivial task. SailKit simplifies this process by:

- Offering a clean and intuitive API for composing, rendering, and previewing email templates.
- Providing Svelte 5 primitives that feel natural and ergonomic to use.
- Translating your Svelte components into optimized MJML markup under the hood.
- Leveraging MJML's industry-standard email rendering engine to generate high-quality, responsive HTML that adheres to best practices.

### Why MJML?

[MJML](https://mjml.io) is an industry standard for composing email templates. It provides a robust foundation that handles the complexities of email client compatibility. Rather than reinventing the wheel, SailKit leverages MJML's proven engine while providing a modern, Svelte-based developer experience.

### Features

- üéØ **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support
- üì± **Responsive by Default**: Powered by MJML's engine
- ‚ö° **Great DX**: Svelte primitives for composing templates
- üõ†Ô∏è **Simple API**: Intuitive methods for rendering and previewing
- üì¶ **Production-Ready**: Outputs highly optimized responsive HTML

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install sailkit mjml
```

### Basic Example

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Html, Body, Section, Column, Text } from "sailkit";

  interface Props {
    text: string;
  }

  let { text = "Hello from SailKit! üëã" }: Props = $props();
</script>

<Html>
  <Body>
    <Section>
      <Column>
        <Text>{text}</Text>
      </Column>
    </Section>
  </Body>
</Html>
```

```ts
import { renderEmail, previewEmail } from "sailkit";

const { html, plainText } = await renderEmail(MyEmail, { text: "Hello World!" });

// Or, if you want to preview the email in your browser
await previewEmail(MyEmail, { text: "Hello World!" });
```

## Documentation

### Core Functionality

SailKit exposes two primary functions: `renderEmail` and `previewEmail`.

#### renderEmail

`renderEmail` converts a Svelte 5 component into email-optimized HTML. It also generates a plain-text version and metadata by default.

#### previewEmail

`previewEmail` renders your Svelte 5 component and launches the resulting HTML in a browser or logs it to the console.

### Components

SailKit provides Svelte primitives for building email templates. Use these logically within layout components to ensure responsiveness and compatibility.

#### General Email Components

- `Html`
- `Head`
- `Body`

#### Layout Components

- `Section`
  - `Section.Group`
- `Column`
  - `Column.Spacer`
  - `Column.Divider`

#### Content Components

- `Image`
- `Table`
- `Social`
  - `Social.Element`

#### Special Components

- `Container`
- `Raw`
